TODO:
	- max heap (use array to store)
	- graphs (a lot more complcated)
	- hashmap (a lot a lot more complicated)



- for animating trees, could add arrows showing where they went, or could try to do actual animations
	- inspo (look at heap animation): https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html

- encapsulate this
