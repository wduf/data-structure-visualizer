TODO:
	- max heap (use array to store)
	- graphs (a lot more complcated)
	- hashmap (a lot a lot more complicated)

- for animating trees, could add arrows showing where they went, or could try to do actual animations
	- inspo (look at heap animation): https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html

- encapsulate this (figure out how in js)
___________________________________________________________________

- add enter in entry box is same as clicking button
- add shortcut to switch between structure tabs (arrow keys, make scalable with tab nums, not manual)
- add div popup that shows instructions and valid num range, have it be accessible by clicking a fancy 'i' somewhere (bottom right?)
- add res scaling for common resolutions

- add zoom-in feature (primarily for bst)
- animate adding/removing everything
