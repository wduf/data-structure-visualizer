ALL DATA STRUCTURES:
- only accept whole numbers (pos or neg), floor decimals
- max value 999999999999999, min value -999999999999999 (+/- 15x9)
	- alternatively, could just do up to 1000 or some arbitrary lower number
- clean input, make sure parameter is an int only
- don't allow NaN as number (why tf does js recognize this as a number)
- don't allow null
- weird quirk with -01234 = -669? if leading zeros on a number that isn't zero, skip them when adding (part of sanitizing input)


BST and Heap:
- insert duplicate either (1) does nothing, or (2) adds a (n + 1) after it
	- ex: already have 10, insert(10) -> 10(2)
	- would need to add a check for this in delete
- insert empty adds to size, sanitize this
